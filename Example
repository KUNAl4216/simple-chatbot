Here's an example of a conversation with the chatbot:

Chatbot: Hello! Type 'bye' to exit the chat.
You: hello
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you today?
You: what is your name
Chatbot: I'm a simple chatbot created in Python.
You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great! How about you?
You: thank you
Chatbot: You're welcome!
You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day!
